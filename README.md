# Game-Programming-Course-Week-1
In the first week of the Game Programming course, I started learning the fundamentals of game development using Unity. <br>
As part of our coursework, I built a simple 3D game to apply the concepts we covered. This project demonstrates the core skills I learned, including: <br>

- Creating a new 3D project in Unity.
- Adding and manipulating basic objects (such as a cube) within a scene.
- Applying materials to objects to change their appearance (e.g., changing the color of the cube to blue).
- Writing C# scripts to control object behavior and movement.
- Using Unity's `Start` and `Update` functions to handle initial object positioning and continuous movement.

In this project, you can move a cube around a 3D scene using the arrow keys, and the movement is handled through scripts that modify the object's position in real time. This project helped me gain a basic understanding of Unity's interface, game objects, and scripting.
